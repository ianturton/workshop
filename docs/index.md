# How to Contribute to GeoTools and GeoServer

This site is designed to help new developers join and contribute to the [GeoTools](http://geotools.org) and 
[GeoServer](http://geoserver.org) projects.

GeoTools is the library that is used to build GeoServer (and other projects) so
the first thing we need to do is get a copy of the source code it needs.

Goto [GitHub](github.com) and either create aan account or log into your
existing account.
